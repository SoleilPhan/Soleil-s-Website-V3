		<h1>Yelp Design Challenge</h1>
		<p>A mobile application to help users find the right recipe</p>

		<h4>Task</h4>
		<p>Create a recipes detail and/or search page. Each recipe has a title, multiple photos, a description, a shopping list, a how-to section, share options, a rating, multiple reviews and user uploaded photos. You are encouraged to add additional elements. You can create your own branding or use Yelp's branding and design as if it's a complementary product. Optimize your design to get users to share the recipe.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="part">
		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>
			The process of searching for a recipe can stem from multiple experiences. It can be spawned from inspiration received though a picture, a holiday coming up, etc. The process of searching for a recipe all the way to sharing a recipe is driven by relevant and eye-catching content at the surface but also in the recipe details page. In order for users to share a recipe, the experience should offer users the option of doing so at multiple levels.</p> 
			<p>
			People eat with their eyes! People salivate over looking at pictures more than reading text about food. When users are searching for recipes, they are mostly intrigued by pictures (assumption 1) over the actual content of what the recipe entails. Based on my assumption, I want the majority of entry points to a recipe to be triggered by the interest of a picture. It's important for the design of the page to be visually orientated based on assumption 1. </p>
		</p>
			<P>I want this app to be a complimentary product to Yelp. With this in mind, I designed using Yelp's branding and voice.</P>
		<h4>Identifying the User</h4>

			<figcaption>User flow goal</figcaption>
			<P></P>
			<p></p>
			<h5>Two main types of users</h5>
			<p>User A: knows what to search for (offer search bar)</p>
			<p>User B: doesn't know/has vague idea of what to search for (offer suggestions)</p>

		<p>Since user A knows what to search for, the search feature should be easy to find. User B on the other hand might not know what to search for. In their case, the content on the homepage doesn't have to be random but instead presented by context. For example, if July 4th is coming up maybe the options that are shown could be the food pertaining to that holiday. Another example of contextual content could be based on their past searches.</p>

		<p>These two examples could also be applied to what user A sees on their homepage, even before a search query is entered. Because we do not know specifically what the users' intentions are when opening the app, the design should allow users to toggle among a public, friends, and personal profile gives users the flexibility of finding or browsing recipes. </p>

	
	<h4>Identifying Needs</h4>
		<p>After identifying the user, we have a clearer understanding of their intentions. The features that should be included at entry level should consist of the main tasks: search, browse feed, save and share recipe. The features that dive deeper only appear on the recipe detail page: view photos, write a review, upload photos in addition to the main tasks on the homepage. How can we optimize the design so that the user can find what they're looking for without clicking too many things or having to go through multiple steps before arriving at their goal. The next steps in the process was to quickly sketch different versions of a homepage.</p>

	<h4>Low Fidelity Sketches</h4>
	<h5>Homepage</h5>
	<p><img src="../assets/yelp_homepage.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:99%;box-shadow:none"></p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p>On the homepage, there are many ways that recipes could be displayed. I sketched out multiple ways the content could be presented. There are many ways variations that could include by popularity, by holiday, recipes by friends, user's saved recipes, etc. Taking a step back, I categorized all of the content into two views explored in the second image. By offering users to toggle between a public and friends, it narrows down the results.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p><img src="../assets/yelp_views.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:90%;box-shadow:none"></p>
		<figcaption>Three different homepage views</figcaption>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<P>After reviewing the paper sketches where I divided the recipe results into two categories, I took a step back and came to the conclusion that there should actually be three different views: a public view, a network view, and a profile view. Although the public and network view contain similar actions, the user would be filtering or browsing different types of content. The profile view which I added allows users to have a place where they can solely see their personal and saved recipes. Instead of having the toggle at the top of the screen, it made more sense to create a navigation bar that lives at the bottom of the screen universally.</P>
		<h5>Recipe Details</h5>
		<p><img src="../assets/yelp_share.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:99%;box-shadow:none"></p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p>For the recipe details page, the content that lives within this page includes: title, photos, description, ingredient list, how-to, option to share, and write a review. Similar to Yelp's app where each restaurant contains a lot of information, each recipe contains a lot as well. For the recipe details page, I referred to Yelp's design in that the design gives the user a glimpse of every category along with a button that shows them more on a different screen.</p>
		<h5>Search</h5>
		<p>In this design exploration, I am focusing on the homepage "search" rather than what the user sees when they select the search icon. I believe that if the design is optimized enough, the manual search will hopefully be less relevant.</p>
		<p></p>

	<h4>Final Design</h4>

		<p></p>
			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<p>In my final design exploration, I was able to hone in on the features that would encourage the user to engage and participate within the recipes app. Based on the problems I uncovered during the research phase, I believe I was able to solve and enhance the user experience. If I were to take this exploration further, I would dive into the search feature,more specifically what the user sees when they select the search icon.</p>
