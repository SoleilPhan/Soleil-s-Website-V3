		<h1>Yelp Design Challenge</h1>
		<p>A mobile application to help users find the right recipe</p>

		<h4>Task</h4>
		<p>Create a recipes detail and/or search page. Each recipe has a title, multiple photos, a description, a shopping list, a how-to section, share options, a rating, multiple reviews and user uploaded photos. You are encouraged to add additional elements. You can create your own branding or use Yelp's branding and design as if it's a complementary product. Optimize your design to get users to share the recipe.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="part">
		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>
			The process of searching for a recipe can stem from multiple experiences. It can be spawned from inspiration received though a picture, a holiday coming up, etc. The process of searching for a recipe all the way to sharing a recipe is driven by relevant and eye-catching content at the surface but also in the recipe details page. In order for users to share a recipe, the experience should offer users the option of doing so at multiple levels.</p> 
			<p>
			People eat with their eyes! People salivate over looking at pictures more than reading text about food. When users are searching for recipes, they are mostly intrigued by pictures (assumption 1) over the actual content of what the recipe entails. Based on my assumption, I want the majority of entry points to a recipe to be triggered by the interest of a picture. It's important for the design of the page to be visually orientated based on assumption 1. </p>
		</p>
			<P>I want this app to be a complimentary product to Yelp. With this in mind, I designed using Yelp's branding and voice.</P>
		<h4>Identifying the User</h4>
		<p><img src="../assets/Yelp_userflow.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:96%;box-shadow:none"></p>
			<P></P>
			<p></p>
			<h5>Two main types of users</h5>
			<p>User A: knows what to search for (offer search bar)</p>
			<p>User B: doesn't know/has vague idea of what to search for (offer suggestions)</p>

		<p>Since user A knows what to search for, the search feature should be easy to find. User B on the other hand might not know what to search for. In their case, the content on the homepage doesn't have to be random but instead presented by context. For example, if July 4th is coming up maybe the options that are shown could be the food pertaining to that holiday. Another example of contextual content could be based on their past searches.</p>

		<p>These two examples could also be applied to what user A sees on their homepage, even before a search query is entered. Because we do not know specifically what the users' intentions are when opening the app, the design should allow users to toggle among a public, friends, and personal profile gives users the flexibility of finding or browsing recipes. </p>

	
	<h4>Identifying Needs</h4>
		<p>After identifying the user, we have a clearer understanding of their intentions. The features that should be included at entry level should consist of the main tasks: search, browse feed, save and share recipe. The features that dive deeper only appear on the recipe detail page: view photos, write a review, upload photos in addition to the main tasks on the homepage. How can we optimize the design so that the user can find what they're looking for without clicking too many things or having to go through multiple steps before arriving at their goal. The next steps in the process was to quickly sketch different versions of a homepage.</p>

	<h4>Low Fidelity Sketches</h4>
	<h5>Homepage</h5>
	<p><img src="../assets/yelp_homepage.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:99%;box-shadow:none"></p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p>On the homepage, there are many ways that recipes could be displayed. I sketched out multiple ways the content could be presented. There are many ways variations that could include by popularity, by holiday, recipes by friends, user's saved recipes, etc. Taking a step back, I categorized all of the content into two views explored in the second image. By offering users to toggle between a public and friends, it narrows down the results.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p><img src="../assets/yelp_views.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:90%;box-shadow:none"></p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<P>After reviewing the paper sketches where I divided the recipe results into two categories, I took a step back and came to the conclusion that there should actually be three different views: a public view, a network view, and a profile view. Although the public and network view contain similar actions, the user would be filtering or browsing different types of content. The profile view which I added allows users to have a place where they can solely see their personal and saved recipes. Instead of having the toggle at the top of the screen, it made more sense to create a navigation bar that lives at the bottom of the screen universally.</P>
		<h5>Recipe Details</h5>
		<p><img src="../assets/yelp_share.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:99%;box-shadow:none"></p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p>For the recipe details page, the content that lives within this page includes: title, photos, description, ingredient list, how-to, option to share, and write a review. Similar to Yelp's app where each restaurant contains a lot of information, each recipe contains a lot as well. For the recipe details page, I referred to Yelp's design in that the design gives the user a glimpse of every category along with a button that shows them more on a different screen.</p>
		<h5>Search</h5>
		<p>In this design exploration, I am focusing on the homepage "search" rather than what the user sees when they select the search icon. I believe that if the design is optimized enough, the manual search will hopefully be less relevant.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
	<h4>High Fidelity Mockups</h4>
		<h5>Homepage</h5>
		<p><img src="../assets/yelp_homehifi.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:99%;box-shadow:none;"></p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>	
			<p><b>Left:</b> I placed the toggle at the top of the screen under the header that dictates what kind of content presented. In this mockup, the user has the world icon selected meaning the recipes are from public users.</p>
			<p><b>Right:</b> In this version, I added a universal navigation bar at the bottom of the screen and added a bar at the top where the user could select keywords to further filter the type of content shown. </p>
			<p><b>Takeaway:</b> The right version made more sense because since the toggle is universal (meaning it's always on every screen), it is always going to be there for the user if they want to return to the homepage. The con of the first version is that it would scroll with the content meaning that it's not always in the viewport. This could prove as an inconvenienve especially when a user is deeper into the recipe details page. In the right mockup, the keywords that appear in the bar could be based on user's past searches, any holiday coming up, trending searches, etc. This is something I won't expand on in this particular design exploration but by including a keyword bar, the goal is to help the user narrow down their recipe search without having to select the search icon.</p>
		<h5>Recipe Details</h5>
			<p><img src="../assets/yelp_recdethifi.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:99%;box-shadow:none;"></p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Takeaway</b>: For the recipe details page, I referred to Yelp's mobile app. Because there is a lot of information that resides within each recipe, I made the decision to include snippets of each category rather than displaying all the information at once. For example if a user wanted to just look at the How-To section, they could scroll to that section and select the corresponding button to view more on a separate screen.</p>
		<h5>Share a recipe</h5>
			<p><img src="../assets/yelp_sharehifi.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:99%;box-shadow:none;"></p>
			<figcaption>Modal pop-up versus separate share screen</figcaption>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Left:</b> In this version, the design allows the user to share a recipe via a modal that pop ups once they have selected "Send on Yelp Recipes". If the user wants to cancel or return, they would select the X. The same modal would appear to share the recipe on social media.</p>
			<p><b>Right:</b> Similar to the Yelp mobile app, this version takes the user to a separate screen to complete the step. In order for the user to return to the previous screen, they would select the back button located in the header.</p>
			<p><b>Takeaway:</b> Although the left design allows the user to still see the recipe they are sending in the background, that was the only benefit I could see from it. Having a separate screen for sharing a recipe would offer the real estate to also allow the user to share on social media. It also follows the heuristic of a separate screen for completing the next step in a process that users experience in the recipe details page (i.e., "see all photos" takes users to a separate screen to view).</p>

		<p></p>
	<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<p>In my final design exploration, I was able to hone in on the features that would encourage the user to engage and participate within the recipes app. Based on the problems I uncovered during the research phase, I believe I was able to solve and enhance the user experience. If I were to take this exploration further, I would dive into the search feature,more specifically what the user sees when they select the search icon.</p>
