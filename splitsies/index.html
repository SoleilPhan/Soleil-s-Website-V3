		<h4>The Project</h4>
		<p>I designed a iOS app that allows users to split a bill, calculate tax and tip, and charge people. In this project, I worked with a developer to flesh out the user experience. I was responsible for the visual and interaction design for the app.</p>

		<h4>Current Version of Splitsies</h4>
		<p>
		In our first iteration that was pushed to the app store, our focus was on the user experience. Since the user needed Venmo, I closely looked at the user flow that Venmo adopted since it was an experience that the user was probably already familiar with.
		</p>
		<p>On the first set of actions, the user would enter in their meal amount and have the ability to add friends' meal amounts. The next step had the user add a description for the meal and review the summary before confirming. While these steps seems simple, it actually proposed issues.</p>

	<h4>Feedback</h4>
	<p>After pushing the first version to the app store, many of our friends tested it and gave us feedback that helped us refine the UX. On the first screen, the combination of adding the user's own personal meal and their friends' meal on the same screen caused confusion because it wasn't clear what the user should do first. Although the order technically did not matter, bundling the two steps together confused the user- something we did not intend to do. Another significant issue was the tax and tip text fields at the bottom of the initial screen. The tax and tip should be the final step because the amount inputted by the user should apply to everyone's meal instead of every individuals' meal. These issues were something that made me rethink the process.</p>


<h4>The Redesign</h4>

<p>Two top level problems that we came across:
<p>1. Combining multiple steps onto one screen caused confusion user didn't know what to input first</p>
<p>2. User's did not know if the tip percentage apply to everyones meal? or does it apply to each persons meal (hint: should apply to overall meal and then split)</p>

			<figcaption>The redesign</figcaption>
<p>The design is a working concept and currently undergoing changes. In the new design that embodies an updated UX and UI, I wanted to create a more hand held experience that guided the user through a step by step process. While the redesign added more steps/pages, it clearly provides a clear understanding of what the user is inputting throughout the entirety of the process that the user might lack in the current UX.
