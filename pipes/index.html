		<h4>The Project</h4>
		<p>In this project, I designed a dashboard for moving information into a data warehouse and visualizing the stored data. In this case, the Simple Data Pipe it's an application that moves information from dashDB (IBM's cloud data warehouse service).</p>

		<h4>Initial Designs</h4>
			<p>For the user to transfer their information in this dashboard, they would have to go through a series of steps in order to complete the entire process. Without one step, the user would not be able to proceed so it was important for the user flow to make sense in an operational matter.</p>

			</div>
			<p>In our initial iterations, I designed the dashboard with two tabs on the left that contained multiple steps within each. As mentioned previously, a user cannot complete one step without the previous step. In this case, the design that includes multiple steps in one page makes it more complex on both ends because it provides less clear guidance for the user to complete every step. </p>
	<h4>Feedback</h4>
		<p>The main pieces of feedback we received from our peers were that the steps should be separated into individual tabs. This made sense because in the initial designs, there existed solely two tabs so the real estate for additional tabs existed. Another piece of feedback we got was that there was no necessary need for a secondary navigation bar if each step was going to be divided out into their own tab. This would allow for the last tab to be Activity and the configuration steps to precede it. </p>
	<h4>Final Design</h4>
		<p>In the final design, we went with the feedback and separated each step into it's own tab. This allowed for a more clear and completed process for the user to go through. Instead of the Configuration tab, we extracted these and created four steps/tabs: Connect, Pick Tables, Schedule, and Activity.</p>
