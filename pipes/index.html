		<h4>The Project</h4>
		<p>In this project, I designed a dashboard for moving information into a data warehouse and visualizing the stored data. In this case, the Simple Data Pipe it’s an application that moves information from dashDB (IBM’s cloud data warehouse service).</p>

<p>For the user to transfer their information in this dashboard, they would have to go through a series of steps in order to complete the necessary steps. Without one step, the user would not be able to proceed so it was important for the user flow to make sense in an operational matter.</p>

		<h4>Initial Designs</h4>
		<p>
		We initially started off the process by looking at competitors’ websites targeted toward developers. More specifically, the user flow they implemented in order to display a wide variety of content. 

		We needed to solve the problem of creating a hub of organized resources in a developer’s initial process of finding a solution for their product.

		<h4>Final Design</h4>
		<p>In the final design, we went with the feedback and separated each step into it’s own tab. This allowed for a more clear and completed process for the user to go through. Instead of the Configuration tab, we extracted these and created four steps/tabs: Connect, Pick Tables, Schedule, and Activity.</p>
