		<h4>The Project</h4>
		I designed a website for IBM Cloud Data Services that includes a portfolio of integrated, best-of-breed services for developers focused on mobile computing and analytics use cases.
		As part of the Developer Advocacy team, I was responsible to research and design a website intended to be used by developers.
	</div>

		<h4>Research</h4>
		<p>
		We initially started off the process by looking at competitors’ websites targeted toward developers. More specifically, the user flow they implemented in order to display a wide variety of content. 

		We needed to solve the problem of creating a hub of organized resources in a developer’s initial process of finding a solution for their product. 
		</p>
		<h5>Provide a overview of services.</h5>
			<p>Because there are so many services within this department at IBM, including a page with a high level description of each would allow for the user to quickly browse instead of having to dig through content.</p>
		<h5>Creating a voice.</h5>
			<p>Designing a website that was cohesive was important. We noticed other sites where each page looked like it was a part of separate websites instead of one whole website. In addition, we found that many sites offered multiple navigation bars that confused the user more rather than guiding them.</p>
		<h5>Allow users to cater their search.</h5>
			<p>Considering this website was intended as a growing resource hub, it was important for the user to be able to quickly search for a solution among many possibilities. We wanted to utilize a faceted search engine that would allow the developer to filter their preferences anywhere from language to topic.</p>
		<h5>Interacting with the community of developers.</h5>
			<p>Many of the people on our team are a part of Developer Advocacy which means it’s their responsibility to make it easier for other developers to use the technology. With frequent meetups, demos, and conferences, we wanted a place where other developers could interact with IBM’s developers by reading blog posts or attending events. </p>
		<h4>Initial Iterations</h4>
		<p>In these early stage iterations, we focused on the the first fold of the homepage. Being the first thing any user sets their eyes on, we wanted quick calls to action and a search bar to speed up their process of finding a solution. We realized that although having a search bar was convenient for those who were new or returning users, this would give for a wide variety of queries that would potentially take users to the wrong answer. In replace of the search bar there, we received lots of feedback of including a message or phrase that introduced users to the goal of the site.</p>

		<p>Another main feature included the search. In the beginning, we included many icons that signified what type of search result it was. Although this was helpful, the amount and type of search results were too complicated and overlapped (i.e., could have more than one icon). Simplification of the overall page was needed.</p>

		<p>As a whole, our initial mockups didn’t have a strong voice that tied it together. In order to tie every page together we needed something to live consistently and add some “attitude” to the site. </p>
