		<h4>The Project</h4>
		I designed a website for IBM Cloud Data Services that includes a portfolio of integrated, best-of-breed services for developers focused on mobile computing and analytics use cases.
		As part of the Developer Advocacy team, I was responsible to research and design a website intended to be used by developers.

		<h4>Research</h4>
		<p>
		We initially started off the process by looking at competitors’ websites targeted toward developers. More specifically, the user flow they implemented in order to display a wide variety of content. 

		We needed to solve the problem of creating a hub of organized resources in a developer’s initial process of finding a solution for their product. 
		</p>
		<h5>Provide a overview of services.</h5>
			<p>Because there are so many services within this department at IBM, including a page with a high level description of each would allow for the user to quickly browse instead of having to dig through content.</p>
		<h5>Creating a voice.</h5>
			<p>Designing a website that was cohesive was important. We noticed other sites where each page looked like it was a part of separate websites instead of one whole website. In addition, we found that many sites offered multiple navigation bars that confused the user more rather than guiding them.</p>
		<h5>Allow users to cater their search.</h5>
			<p>Considering this website was intended as a growing resource hub, it was important for the user to be able to quickly search for a solution among many possibilities. We wanted to utilize a faceted search engine that would allow the developer to filter their preferences anywhere from language to topic.</p>
		<h5>Interacting with the community of developers.</h5>
			<p>Many of the people on our team are a part of Developer Advocacy which means it’s their responsibility to make it easier for other developers to use the technology. With frequent meetups, demos, and conferences, we wanted a place where other developers could interact with IBM’s developers by reading blog posts or attending events. </p>
