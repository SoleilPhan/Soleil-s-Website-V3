		<h4>The Project</h4>
		<p>I redesigned the documentation website for IBM Cloudant. As part of a team of writers and engineers, my responsibility was to re-create the experience of how a user would explore the overview of Cloudant Basics, API Reference, and Client Libraries.</p>
	</div>

		<h4>What Existed</h4>
		<p>The website that existed included a two column layout: one column for the section and the other for the main content that included text and code snippets. After researching other websites for developers, I noticed a common pattern of having a third column on the right exclusively for the code snippets.</p> 
 

		<p>This would mean that instead of including the snippets in the actual text, it would be aligned accordingly and designated and to the third column. This made sense because users would have the ability to toggle between languages in this column as opposed to switching in the text. Although this option would call for a more organized consumption of material, the problem of “wasted space” came up because not all pieces of text presented code snippets.</p>

		<h4>Final Design</h4>
		<p>In the final design, we went with the feedback and separated each step into it’s own tab. This allowed for a more clear and completed process for the user to go through. Instead of the Configuration tab, we extracted these and created four steps/tabs: Connect, Pick Tables, Schedule, and Activity.</p>
