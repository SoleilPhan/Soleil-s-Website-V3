		<h1>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</h1>
		<p>A demo demonstrating the degrees of separation between Kevin Bacon and any other actor built on top of IBM Graph Data Store.<a href="http://6degress-of-kevin-bacon.mybluemix.net/" target="_blank"style="font-weight:400; color:#bababa"> Visit website here.</a></p>

			<h4>The Project</h4>

		<h4>Current Design</h4>
		<p>The initial design makes use of minimal color but benefit from more visual direction. At a quick glance, the user would see majority of the page to be text but because this is a more playful demo, it needed the use of graphics and additional color to make it more appealing.</p>

		<h4>Proposed Design</h4>
		<p>In the redesign, I focused on the first fold which ultimately set the tone for the rest of the page. I created a logo that defined what the demo did, a piece of bacon folded into the number 6, and added in a graphic that demonstrated the idea of separation.</p>

		<p>In the second half of the page, I decided to divide the pieces of content into its own bucket. The most important piece of information is the number, or degree, that depicts the degree of separation. Thus the numner stayed in the upper left corner. Next, the query snippet next, and the graph displayed in full width to help the user visualize the data they queried.</p>
