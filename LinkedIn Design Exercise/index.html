		<h1>LinkedIn Design Exercise</h1>
		<p>An experience for users who are visitng after three or more months</p>
	</div>
	<div class="part">
		<h4>Task</h4>
		<p>Design a welcome back experience for a dormant user who is returning after 3+ months. Find a creative solution that gains the dormant user's attention, and garners an action to actively participate on LinkedIn in any way.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="part">
		<h4>The Problem</h4>
		<p>
			LinkedIn's mission is "to connect the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful". How is LinkedIn able to make a dormant user more productive and successful? According to the 2015 Talent Trends, "70% of the global workforce is passive talent". LinkedIn states that "almost 4 in 10 professionals are researching new jobs and networking even though only 30% are actively looking for a new job" . Right now, LinkedIn lets users include high level content (i.e., summary, experience, accomplishments) that would lend well to the act of job hunting but for someone who was once dormant, whether they are or aren't looking for a new job, there should exist the need of augmenting one's own profile and presence within their relevant industry- staying current and up to date.

		<h4>Identifying the User</h4>
		<p>
			For the dormant user who is returning after 3 or more months, there could be two main reasons for their return- either the user is exploring the idea of new job opportunities and/or they are actively speaking with recruiters OR they could be participating in their respective community whether it be browsing or contributing content. As previously mentioned earlier, the type of user I want to focus on is the user who is returning interested in exploring new opportunities. This umbrella user embodies those who are actively looking and those who are open to the idea of a new opportunity.</p>
			<p>Two main use cases:</p>
<p>1. user is actively seeking new job opportunities and is willing to speak to recruiters and respond to messages.</p>
<p>2. user is open to exploring different job opportunities</p>
		<h4>Research</h4>
		<p>I interviewed 6 people one on one who rarely visited Linkedin. I asked them a series of questions based on the reasonings why they visited the site and what specific features they found helpful or find themselves using the most.</p>

<figcaption>Empathy Mapping</figcaption>
	<h4>Main Takeaways</h4>
<p><img src="../assets/takeaway.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:98%"></p>
	
	<h4>Identifying Needs</h4>
		<p>The most common needs I was able to unpack from the empathy maps are the ability to look at a user's professional history, confidence in the completion of their profile, and relevant content. From the research interviews conducted, passive users expressed that being able to look at another users' professional history allowed them to get an idea of a potential trajectory for their personal career. Most of the people interviewed also expressed frustration and disinterest in ads and content presented in their news feed.
</p>
	<h4>Identifying Insights</h4>
		<p>Based on the needs established by the passive users, I was able to look at the bigger picture in order to define what users were most interested in using and how their experience could be better curated by contextually understanding their goals and needs. How does a user consume more relevant and accurate content (i.e., ads, content, job postings) and how can we engage the user to input additional or missing information. The more user-curated data that is inputted, the more relevant content they can consume and the more rich data LinkedIn can provide.</p>

	<h4>Low Fidelity Sketches</h4>
	<p><img src="../assets/paper.png" target="_blank"draggable="false" style="width:99%"></p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<h5>Prototype A</h5>
		<p>On the homepage, the user is greeted with a Welcome Back message. In the first section, Profile Strength gets highlighted. Currently, this feature is located on a user's profile to the right but being able to relocate this form of gamification and transform it into an action-oriented task will motivate the users not only add more content but in turn help LinkedIn's algorithms. </p>
		<h5>Prototype B</h5>
		<p>Similar to prototype A, this version includes the Profile Strength feature at the top to reinforce users to get to the next level. Instead of adding action tasks within the same section, the following modals allow the users several options where they are able to add skills to further enhance their profile and to engage within their community through blogs or browsing similar profiles to them.</p>
		<h5>Prototype C</h5>
		<p>In this version, the first section is divided into three parts the first being profile strength, next being job posts, and the third being the number of people who have viewed the user's profile. Because these three pieces of information are within the same section, the level of information provided is very high-level.</p>
		<h4>Narrowing the Scope</h4>
		<p>After a taking a step back at the paper prototypes, the common theme throughout was a heavy focus on the user inputting more information about them, whether it be adding skills or looking at profile trends. There wasn't one specific version that I gravitated toward, it was bits and pieces of each prototype that culminated toward a holistic experience that engages the user.</p>
	<h4>Final Design</h4>

		<p>The LinkedIn profile strength feature was designed to encourage LinkedIn users to add as much self-curated data as possible. However, LinkedIn doesn't directly offer task-based suggestions that would help a user know how to strengthen their profile. In addition to the lack of actionable items, this feature is only viewable on a user's profile, not the homepage. I believe that this feature can be relocated and used in conjunction with a section that encourages the user to add additional self-curated data.</p>

			<p>A section I chose to include was a skills section that allows the user to, with one-click, add additional skills to their profile. Another feature was to input their goals, no matter if its short term or long term. While it helps the user work toward a written goal, it also allows LinkedIn to pick up on the keywords that would help increase data accuracy.</p>

			<figcaption>Events Page</figcaption>
			<p>The next two sections are Events and People Similar to you. Users expressed the need to be up to date with news of their respective industry. While it is insightful to read about the latest news, adding in a tailored Events section gives the users the opportnities to physically particiate in their industry. By adding an Events section and a dedicated page, users can create events, view past events, and attend or browse upcoming events. If LinkedIn users have the ability to create events that users can attend, not only does it allow users to commit and engage with events, LinkedIn can provide a user's personal profile and populate entry information creating a community of events as well as track a user's past history with event attendance.Based on the interviews I conducted, there was also prevalent need to see other people's work history and experience.</p>
			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
			<p>In my final design exploration, I was able to hone in on the features that would encourage the passive user to engage and participate within the site. Based on the problems I uncovered during the research phase, I hope to solve and enhance the current user experience. If I were to take this exploration further, I would dive into the Events page because whether the user is or isn't looking for a job, being able to attend or plan on attending a future event is a feature that is sticky and can increase the likelihood of a user returning back to the site more often.</p>
