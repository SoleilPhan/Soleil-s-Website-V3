		<h1>Compass</h1>
		<p>Compass is a web application that allows you to create lists filled places you have always wanted to go.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="part">
		<h4>The Project</h4>
		<p>I designed a web application that allows people to track and share travel recommendations.
		As part of a team that consisted of one back-end engineer and one front-end engineer, my responsibility was to create a user flow where users can create a hit list, add points of interest and lastly to be able to share their list with friends.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="part">
		<h4>The problem that exists</h4>
		<p>
		Hard to keep track of travel recommendations.
		</p>
		<p>Provide a overview of services.</p>
		<p>People use different tools to capture and share travel recommendations</p>
		<h4>Initial iteration</h4>
<p><img src="../Assets/compass1.png" target="_blank"draggable="false"></p>
<figcaption>Hierarchy is unclear.</figcaption>
<p><img src="../Assets/compass2.png" target="_blank" draggable="false"></p>
<figcaption>Users can select between either a list or map view.</figcaption>
	<h4>Feedback</h4>
		<p>Map view alone isn’t really that helpful so there is no point in having that option. Instead of having two separate view options, I decided to go back and create a hybrid view that included the list and the map at the same time. This allowed the user to view a list item’s details while also being able to see where it is located on the map. In addition to the feedback, it was time to implement a stylistic voice.</p>

		<p>Another feature that was not implemented yet was being able to share a list. Similar to the schema of Google Docs, we resolved to add a share button on the list page.</p>
	<h4>Final Design</h4>
		<p><img src="../Assets/compass3.png" target="_blank"draggable="false"></p>
		<h5>Core functionality</h5>
		<p>1. People like to see where other people are going to.</p>
		<p>2. Save these places into a list</p>
		<p>3. Look up the location of these places</p>
